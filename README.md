# Classical Turkish Music Dataset

You can view the dataset I have used to train the network below. The dataset contains 61 pieces of classical turkish music sequences : aranagme, meyan, zemin, nakarat. We have prepared the dataset without considering the microtonality of the turkish music. The samples are in the scale of hijaz.
